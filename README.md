<h3 id="howItWorks">How It Works</h3>
The game is played on a 3x3 grid. 
First player to get 3 marks (up, down, across, or diagonal) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
Player 1 clicks on a box to enter their 'game piece', then Player 2.

<h3 id="whatILearned">What I Learned</h3> 
I learned about CSS styling and adding objects to the DOM to create a gameboard.
I practiced algorithms and problem solving skills. 

<h3 id="optimizations">Optimizations:</h3>
I would like to provide the following future features/optimizations:
<br><br>
<ul>
  <li>Add additional functions - such as alerts for Player 1 or Player 2's turn</li>
  <li>Add points counter</li>
  <li>Add additional styling and animation</li>
</ul>
